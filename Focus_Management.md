# Focus Management

## Question 1: What is Deep Work?

Deep work is when one focuses completely on one task without any distractions.

It also means avoiding shallow tasks like checking mail, scrolling on your phone, etc.

Deep work saves a lot of time too.

Cal Newport says this type of focus is rare today; it makes you valuable in your career.

## Question 2: How to do deep work properly?

### 1. Take breaks

Avoid trying to concentrate all day. After 60–90 minutes of intense work, take a serious break.

### 2. Avoiding interruptions

Move your phone to a different room. Instruct others not to bother you.

### 3. Establish a schedule

Do deep work every day at the same time. Your brain adjusts to it.

### 4. Put an end to checking the phone.

When working deeply, avoid checking your email or messages. You become distracted each time you switch.

## Question 3: How can I use this in my daily life?

Schedule deep work time daily (10 AM – 1 PM). Avoid distraction at this time.

Storing my phone in my bag or putting it on Airplane Mode. 

Starting slow, if 1 hour seems excessive, begin with 25 minutes and work my way up.

Planning a break like:

- Walk

- checking important mail

## Question 4: What are the dangers of social media?

### 1. Kills focus

Social media apps grab attention. Using them makes it harder to focus on work.

### 2. Makes you compare

Seeing everyone's happy moments makes you feel your life is boring.

### 3. Wastes time

You open your phone for 2 minutes and end up scrolling for 40 minutes.

### 4. Reduces attention span

These days short-form content reduces the attention span.
