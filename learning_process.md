### Question 2  
### What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting stories for me from the video were about Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison.  
I found Dali’s way of solving problems especially interesting. Whenever he got stuck while painting, he would sit on a chair holding keys in his hand and relax until he almost fell asleep. When the keys fell, the sound would wake him up. At that moment, his brain became active again and helped him think of new ideas.

### Question 3  
### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active mode of thinking is when we are fully focused and concentrating on a task.  
Diffused mode of thinking is when the brain is relaxed but still working in the background.

When Dali relaxed and almost fell asleep, he entered diffused mode.  
As soon as he woke up, his brain shifted back to active mode. This combination helped him think creatively and solve problems better.
