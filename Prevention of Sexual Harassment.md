# Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH)

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Any behaviour that causes someone to feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or disrespected is considered sexual harassment. It might be verbal, visual, or physical.

### Examples include:

- Making dirty jokes or sexual remarks. 

- Sending inappropriate messages, photos, or videos.

- Touching inappropriately.

- Staring at someone in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

## 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

### If I face sexual harassment:

- I will ask the person to stop.  

- I’ll save any texts, emails, or photos for proof.  

- I will find a witness.

- Will report it to HR or the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC).

### If I see someone being harassed:

- I will encourage them to report it.

- If it’s serious, I’ll report it myself.
