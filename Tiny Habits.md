# Tiny Habits — Assignment

## Question 1

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea for me was the story of BJ Fogg doing just two push-ups after brushing his teeth. It looked very small and simple. But from that small action, he built a strong habit. I understood that we don’t need to start big. Even small habits can create big change slowly.

## Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

B = MAP means:

- M = Motivation  
- A = Ability  
- P = Prompt  

It means behaviour happens when these three things come together. If I want to build a habit, I should make it easy (Ability) and attach it to something I already do (Prompt). For example, I can read one page after dinner. Dinner is the prompt, and one page is easy to do.

## Question 3

**Why is it important to celebrate after completing a habit?**

Celebrating is important because it makes us feel happy. When we feel happy, our brain remembers it and wants to repeat it again. Even a small smile or saying “good job” to myself can help me continue the habit daily.

## Question 4

**In this video, what was the most interesting idea for you?**

The most interesting idea was that small improvement every day can make a big difference in the future. Even getting 1% better daily can give very big results after some time.

## Question 5

**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

The book says habits are connected with identity. We should not only focus on goals. We should focus on becoming the type of person we want to be. For example, instead of saying “I want to read books,” I should say “I am a reader.” When I believe this, my actions will slowly match my identity.

## Question 6

**How can you make a habit easier to do?**

To make a habit easier, we should remove obstacles. Keep things ready. For example, if I want to read at night, I can keep a book near my bed. If it is easy to access, I will do it without thinking too much.

## Question 7

**How can you make a habit harder to do?**

To stop a bad habit, we should make it difficult. For example, I can keep my phone in another room while sleeping. If the phone is not near me, I will not use it immediately after waking up.

## Question 8

**One habit I want to do more**

I want to read books regularly and improve my knowledge.

## Question 9

**One habit I want to stop**

I want to reduce my screen time and avoid using my phone late at night.
