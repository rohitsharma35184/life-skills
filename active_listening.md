## What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? 

Pay full attention – Give your undivided attention to the speaker, avoiding distractions like phone, texting someone.

Showing that you're listening - This includes non-verbal body language like making eye contact, and open body positions.

Give feedback – Summarize what the speaker said to confirm understanding.

Defer judgment – Avoid interrupting or responding while the person is speaking.

Respond appropriately – Provide adequate and respectful responses that demonstrate your comprehension of the message.

Ask questions – If any doubt about something, ask questions to verify and maximize understanding.

## According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

Content Mirroring: Repeat the main facts back to the speaker. This shows you understood the “what” of their message.

Empathy / Feeling Mirroring: Notice and acknowledge the speaker’s emotions. For example, “You seem frustrated” or “I can see you’re excited.” This makes them feel heard.

Verification: After summarising, ask the speaker if your version is correct. This avoids confusion and builds clarity.

Non-Directiveness: Don’t jump in with advice or change the topic. Let the speaker lead the flow of the conversation.

Encouragement: Use small prompts like “Hmm,” “I see,” or nodding to show you’re following along.

Trust Building: By reflecting both facts and feelings, you create a safe space where the speaker feels respected and understood.

## What are the obstacles in your listening process?
  
Distractions: Mobile phone, background noise, or thinking of other work.

Pre‑judging: Deciding what the person means before they finish.

Planning reply too early: Making your answer in your head while the other person is still talking.

Impatience: Wanting the speaker to “come to the point” quickly.

Misunderstanding: Language or cultural differences can confuse the meaning.

## What can you do to improve your listening? 

Stay present: Give full attention, keep phone aside, don’t multitask.

Show interest: Nod, keep eye contact, small words like “hmm” or “okay , Got it.”

Repeat back: Say the main point again in your own words to confirm.

Ask questions: If something is not clear, politely ask.

Hold judgment: Listen fully before giving advice or opinion.

Take notes: In meetings or technical talks, write down details so nothing is missed.

## When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?  

When I don’t want to argue.

In office meetings, sometimes I stay quiet because I don’t want conflict.

## When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?

When I am extremely frustrated and I need to get my point across.  

At work, for example, if deadlines are not met.

## When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?

When I do not want to fight, but I want to show displeasure.

Giving sarcastic remarks like “Wow, great job” whereas I am actually saying the opposite.

Gossiping about someone rather than telling them.

## How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyse the videos, then think what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life? 

Be transparent-clear and direct: Say exactly what you mean or feel without concealing it or yelling.

Use “I” statements: For example, “I feel stressed when deadlines are unclear” instead of blaming.

Calmness: Control tone and body language; don't let emotions take over.

Respect others: Hear them out; do not belittle or insult them.

Set boundaries: Learn to say “no” at the right time and in an amiable manner.

Practice confidence: Stand straight, make full eye contact, and speak steadily.
